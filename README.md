# Activity Recognition using ConvLSTM
Jupyter Notebook implementation of Human Activity Recognition using ConvLSTM 

## Dataset Used
The dataset used in the training process is the UCF50 - Action Recognition Data Set. Dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php)</br>





## ConvLSTM Model Performance
After training on `20 epochs` early stopping CallBack was triggered. `Test Accuracy = 80%`
